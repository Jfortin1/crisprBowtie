# crisprBowtie

Note that the `master` branch or `crisprBowtie` is only compatible with the new `crisprDesignS4` package (refactored `crisprDesign` to be submitted to BioC), and represents the version that we are submitting to Bioconductor. 

To use the `crisprBowtie` with `crisprDesign` (non-refactored) , please use the `preBioc` branch. 

# Dependencies
